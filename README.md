## Instruction to build   

1. install bundler    
  `$ gem install bundler`   
  if you can't install bundler, don't worry, the bundler is only to install the same version cocoapod I used in the project 

2. Yes I can install bundler :smile:    
  Now, go to the project folder and execute the command bellow:   
  `$ bundler install`   
  After executed the command above, you can run `$ bundler exec pod install` to get all pods used in the project   
  OBS: if you executed this step, you can skip the step 3

3. No I can't install bundler :pensive:   
  Too bad, but don't worry, you only need to install the cocoapods. To install Cocoapods run the command bellow:
  `$ sudo gem install cocoapods`    
  Now, go to the project folder and execute the command `$ pod install`

4. Great :+1:, now you can open the project clicking on the file `MediaMonksExercice.xcworkspace`
